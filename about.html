            Hello, my name is Chace Carey and I am a first year student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/">the University of Rhode Island</a>. 
            I'm in the International Computer Science Program (<a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/icsp/">ICSP</a>) at URI which means I'm double majoring in Computer Science and a language.
            However, the language I chose doesn't currently have a major program so I'm currently minoring in Japanese instead.
            I'm considering switching my minor to a major in Global Language and Area Studies (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/programs/program/global-language-and-area-studies-b-a/">GLAS</a>) of Japan. 
            The Computer Science class I'm enrolled in is CSC 106 and it's only the second Computer Science class I've ever taken.
            I took my first Computer Science class in my senior year at high school.
            It was a class that mainly used block coding to create apps through <a target="_blank" href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a>. 
            Later in the year we messed around with using block coding to create battle bots and then learned the very basics of the Python programming language.
