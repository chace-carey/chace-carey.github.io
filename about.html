      <h1>Welcome to Chace's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
        <p> <strong>Welcome to my "<em>About Me</em>" page!</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Hello, my name is Chace Carey and I am a first year student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/">the University of Rhode Island</a>. 
            I'm in the International Computer Science Program (<a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/icsp/">ICSP</a>) at URI which means I'm double majoring in Computer Science and a language.
            However, the language I chose doesn't currently have a major program so I'm currently minoring in Japanese instead.
            I'm considering switching my minor to a major in Global Language and Area Studies (GLAS) of Japan. 
            The Computer Science class I'm enrolled in is CSC 106 and it's only the second Computer Science class I've ever taken.
            I took my first Computer Science class in my senior year at high school.
            It was a class that mainly used block coding to create apps through <a target="_blank" href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a>. 
            Later in the year we messed around with using block coding to create battle bots and then learned the very basics of the Python programming language.
