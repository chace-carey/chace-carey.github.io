            Hello, my name is Chace Carey and I am a first year student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/">the University of Rhode Island</a>. 
            I'm in the International Computer Science Program (<a target="_blank" href="https://web.uri.edu/cs/academics/icsp/">ICSP</a>) at URI which means I'm double majoring in Computer Science and a language.
            However, the language I chose doesn't currently have a major program so I'm currently minoring in Japanese instead.
            I'm considering switching my minor to a major in Global Language and Area Studies (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/programs/program/global-language-and-area-studies-b-a/">GLAS</a>) of Japan. 
            The Computer Science class I'm enrolled in is CSC 106 and it's only the second Computer Science class I've ever taken.
            I took my first Computer Science class in my senior year at high school.
            It was a class that mainly used block coding to create apps through <a target="_blank" href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">MIT App Inventor</a>. 
            Later in the year we messed around with using block coding to create battle bots and then learned the very basics of the Python programming language.
        </p>
          <p class="paragraph"> 
              I'm from a small town in Massachusetts called Carver, it's next to Plymouth, MA and that's how I have to describe it to everyone since only people in the Plymouth county have heard of it.
              I live with my mom, dad, and my sister and we have a dog named Lola. My dad and I love going to baseball games and have decided that we are going to visit every MLB ballpark.
              So far we have been to 12 of the 30 parks. My family and I also love to travel, however it is more my passion than theirs. 
              My favorite trip was a feild trip I took with my school during April vacation. 
              We visited France for 3 days and Spain for 3 days with a day in the middle where we took a train and a bus to travel between the two countries.
              I also love to play video games and this website was actually styled after one of my favorite games <em> "Undertale" </em>.
