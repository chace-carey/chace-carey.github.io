      <h1>Welcome to Chace's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
        <p>This is a collection of programs that I wrote in my CSC106 course at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu/">the University of Rhode Island</a>. 
            I created this site with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">github</a> and the HTML programming language.
            On this site I will be posting the javascript programs that I've written to the "<em>Javascripts</em>" page that can be accessed by simply pressing the "<em>Javascripts</em>" button that is located below this paragraph.
             Also located under this paragraph is a button that will take you to my "<em>About Me</em>" page.
            This page will have a small description that is all about me, the programmer of this website.
            Each page will have the same three buttons to take you to the corresping page that you're looking for.
            If you are on a different page such as the "<em>Javascripts</em>" page or "<em>About Me</em>" page you can click on the "<em>Home</em>" button to return back here.
            <strong>Thank you for visiting my Programming Portfolio!</strong>
